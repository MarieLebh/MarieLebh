## Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm Marie!

- :mortar_board: I'm a PhD student in Evolution and Bioinformatics at the University of MÃ¼nster.
- :dna: I'm interested in understanding how new genes can emerge "*de novo*" (= from noncoding DNA).
- :fly: Started working with fruitflies during my bachelors (at that time still in the lab) and haven't stopped since.
